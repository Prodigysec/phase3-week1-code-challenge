# Python Phase3-Week1-Code-Challenge

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
The goal is to create a function that takes three inputs: the hour (ranging from 1 to 12), the minute (ranging from 0 to 59), and the period ("am" or "pm"). The objective is to return a four-digit string representing the time in the 24-hour clock format.

## Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive.
The goal is to write a function, which takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.

## Challenge 3: Consonant value
The goal is to return the highest value of consonant substrings, given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.
